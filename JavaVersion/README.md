# Big Number Calculator with GUI using JavaFX

The idea of this project is to create a calculator that works exclusively with positive integers, without any limits on the size of the numbers it can handle.

Implemented functionalities include subtraction, multiplication, division, addition, and modulo operations.

The Java program incorporates additional features to mimic a real calculator app. It includes standard memory keys commonly found in calculators. Additionally, the Java code features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using JavaFX, JavaFXML, and SceneBuilder.
