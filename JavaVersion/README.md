# Big Number Calculator with GUI using JavaFX

The idea of this project is to make a calculator, working with only positive integers only, that has no bounds,
regarding the size of the numbers' it is calculating.

I have implemented subtraction,multiplication,divison,addition,modulo operation.

Also i have made a GUI using JavaFX,JavaFXML and SceneBuilder as you can see in the examples below.
